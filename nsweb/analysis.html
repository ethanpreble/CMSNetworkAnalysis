<h3> APPROACH </h3>
<p class="lead"> <font size="4">
We are representing the data as a directed network using companies, doctors, universities, and hospitals as the nodes and each transaction as a directed edge with a weight corresponding to the dollar amount. 
Because of the large amount of data (over ~2M entries), we decided to break it into state data. This makes the data tractable and allows it to be analyzed at the state level. Since in our preliminary analysis of the data we noticed that the financial transactions to hospitals and universities were significantly greater than those to individual doctors, we decided to focus on teaching hospitals and universities. This also has the additive benefit of limiting the number of nodes to a tractable number. For example, in California the total transaction from companies to hospitals was $136,294,412, with 2329 transaction nodes, while the total donation from companies to doctors was $46,327,098, with 222422  transaction nodes. We have chosen CA, NY, and TX as states to perform a detailed network analysis on because these states have many medical schools. We are also currently exploring techniques to visualize bipartite graphs to see the transaction network structure more clearly.

<h3> ANALYSIS </h3>
<p class="lead"> <font size="4">
<h5> Networks</h5>
<ul class="lead"><font size="4">We computed the following network measures:
<li>Nationwide degree distribution</li>
<li>Statewide degree distribution for CA, NY, and TX</li>
<li>Centrality measures of national and state networks</li>
<li>Bipartite network visualization: state and national levels</li>
</ul>
</p>

    <h5> Statistics </h5>
<ul class="lead"><font size="4">We computed the following summary statistics and display visually on Google Maps:
<li>Statewide dollar sums (all 50)</li>
<li>Statewide average transaction amounts</li>
<li>Average number of transactions per doctor/hospital/university</li>
</ul>
