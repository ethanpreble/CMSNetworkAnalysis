    <h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p class="lead"> <font size="4">
The passing of the Affordable Care Act required the establishment of a transparency program, known as Open Payments. The program was created to increase public awareness of financial relationships between drug and device manufacturers and healthcare providers. Specifically, it requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies to report payments or other transfers of value they make to physicians and teaching hospitals. The transactions are further classified by the nature of the payment (i.e. gift, food &amp beverage, consulting, and more.) Moreover, manufacturers must report ownership or investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. Open Payments does not identify which financial relationships are beneficial or which may cause conflicts of interest. Utilizing methods from network science, our aims are two-fold: to visualize the data in a meaningful way and to elucidate the nature of the financial relationship.
